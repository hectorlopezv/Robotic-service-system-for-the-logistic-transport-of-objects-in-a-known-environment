### Resume
At present, robots must supply not only industrial functions, but also be close to everyday activities of the human being. In this sense, service robotics becomes an application opportunity where robots operate in hospital or military areas, airports or restaurants, offices or homes. This is how the participation of service robots has become increasingly necessary and beneficial. With these applications the problem of security in the interaction of robots with humans also arises, since in a variety of applications, joint work between them in the same space is not recommended. With the aim of providing a solution to the above problem, the implementation of the X80 and X80-Pro robots is presented as service robots in a controlled and known environment, for transporting objects from one point to another. To achieve this, a program is developed in Python that allows robots to calculate their trajectory from the point they are to a destination point, using a form of the "A star" algorithm. In the same way, robots will make decisions about their trajectory, depending on the appearance of unknown obstacles along the way, being able to recalculate the route. Additionally, the robots involved coordinate their actions so as not to solve the same task and thus be more efficient. The assignment of tasks is achieved through the implementation of a graphical interface developed in PyQt5, where the same program is responsible for distributing the tasks for the robots, likewise the interface has widgets that show the live information received from the sensors Built-in robots A good system performance was obtained from the project developed, achieving a 82% success rate, where the success of the tests lies in the performance of the tasks assigned to the robots, evading obstacles correctly.
